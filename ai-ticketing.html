                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Korea-Nordic Future Challenge is a collaborative program organized by the Korea Foundation for
                        Advanced Studies (KFAS), Uppsala University, and KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The program
                        aims to foster cultural exchange between students in Korea and Sweden while engaging them in a
                        group project addressing SDG-related challenges in both countries.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Problem</h2>
                    <p>With the goal of contributing to <strong>SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities and SDG 11: Sustainable
                            Cities and
                            Communities</strong>, our team identified <strong>spatial exclusion</strong> as the core
                        issue.</p>
                    <p>Spatial exclusion is a significant problem in Korea. Older adults often feel unwelcome in
                        “trendy” places or districts and end up spending time in spaces such as subways or airports
                        simply because they are free and accessible.</p>
                    <p>This issue is further exacerbated by the rapid surge of digitalization. Many seniors struggle
                        with self-service kiosks or digital ticketing systems, which deepens their sense of
                        exclusion.<br>
                        Digital exclusion is also a critical issue in Sweden, where socially vulnerable groups—including
                        older adults, residents in rural areas, and low-income households—are disproportionately
                        affected.</p>

                    <h2>Needfinding Interviews</h2>
                    <p>To better understand the lived experiences of elderly users, we conducted semi-structured
                        interviews with four participants aged 65 and above—two from Korea and two from Sweden.</p>
                    <p>The interview topics included:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                        <li><strong>Digital Literacy</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span

                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Barriers Identified</h2>
                    <p>A key insight from the interviews was the range of factors that make access to public spaces
                        difficult for elderly users:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Non-Digital Barriers</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
                                class="weak">|</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;financial constraints, physical obstacles such as
                            stairs, limited public transportation in rural areas, and social pressure to remain quiet or
                            unobtrusive
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Digital Barriers</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span
                                class="weak">|</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;difficulty using ticket vending machines, booking

                    <img src="subpage-assets/ai-ticketing/barriers.png" alt="">
                    <p>Among these, <strong>ticketing difficulties</strong> were mentioned most frequently and also
                        aligned closely with
                        our team’s interests. As a result, we decided to focus on improving the ticketing experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>Many participants reported that when faced with ticketing challenges, they either ask family
                        members for help, visit offline vendors if available, or give up entirely.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-emph">Design Problem</h2>

                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>AI Usability Test Session</h2>
                    <p>Based on our interviews, we observed that some elderly users were already using AI tools with
                        relative ease and found conversational interactions intuitive.
                        This led us to explore AI as a potential accessibility tool.</p>
                    <p>We conducted a usability test session to evaluate whether elderly users could complete tasks—such
                        as booking tickets or performing simpler actions—using AI, and to identify interaction barriers
                        in the process.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Insights & Design Rationale</h2>
                    <p>Voice-based AI interactions showed strong potential to lower digital barriers, as participants
                        found natural language communication comfortable and intuitive. However, while voice interaction
                        worked well for simple tasks like fact-checking, it was insufficient for complex, multi-step
                        processes. Long and verbose explanations often caused confusion rather than clarity.</p>
                    <p>Additional usability issues emerged:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sonic cues were unfamiliar and difficult to interpret</li>
                        <li>Users were often unaware of what actions were possible</li>
                        <li>Fear of making mistakes led to hesitation and passive interaction</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Participants also expressed a desire for end-to-end support, including guidance to the event
                        venue after completing ticketing.</p>
                    <p>Based on these findings, we synthesized key insights and corresponding design rationales, shown
                        below.</p>

                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2 class="section-emph">Prototyping</h2>
                    <p>Building on the insights from the usability test, I designed a prototype focused on simplifying
                        the ticketing process.</p>
                    <p>The core concept is to <strong>break down complex tasks into a semi-structured conversational
                            flow</strong>, where each step completes a small, manageable action.<br>
                        “Semi-structured” means that while an example flow exists, the conversation is not rigid. As
                        long as the necessary information for booking is collected, the interaction can adapt flexibly
                        based on user input or agent guidance.</p>
                    <p>This approach ensures that elderly users complete tasks in a <strong>scaffolded manner</strong>,
                        while still leveraging AI’s ability to respond <strong>flexibly to diverse situations</strong>.

                        <li>At each step, the agent confirms whether the recognized information is correct</li>

                    <p>Once the process begins, the agent asks for personal information required for booking. This
                        information is saved so users do not need to repeat it in future sessions.</p>

                    <p>Next, users are asked about their movie preferences. They can specify a particular film, genre,
                        or style, or request a list of trending movies. The agent flexibly curates recommendations based
                        on the request, allowing users to explore alternatives if needed.</p>

                    <p>During booking, the agent collects required details such as cinema location, date and time,
                        screening type (2D, 3D, 4D, etc.), and number of tickets. Seat selection can be made either by
                        specifying seat numbers or expressing higher-level preferences.</p>

                    <h2>Current Project Status</h2>
                    <p>The project has successfully passed the midterm progress review, during which we presented the
                        prototype and received positive feedback.<br>
                        Moving forward, we plan to implement a functional prototype over the winter and conduct further
                        user testing.</p>
                    <p>Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the potential of AI agents as accessibility tools and
                        to advocate for policies that integrate AI into inclusive digital service design.</p>
