                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>In Janurary 2025, I joined Professor Jennifer Kim’s research lab at Georgia Tech to explore how
                        AI can support more inclusive teaching practices in higher education.</p>
                    <p>Our project focused on developing an LLM-powered system that helps instructors adapt their course
                        materials for students with diverse learning needs, grounded in Universal Design for Learning
                        (UDL) principles. UDL is an educational framework that encourages providing multiple ways of
                        engaging learners, presenting information, and expressing understanding so that all students—
                        including those who are neurodivergent or have learning disabilities as well as any student—can
                        access and participate
                        in learning effectively. The goal of our system was to reduce the burden on instructors while
                        making classrooms more accessible, flexible, and equitable.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section background-black">
                    <h2>Goal</h2>
                    <p class="strong">Designing an AI-based system that effectively assists instructors in modifying
                        course materials to be UDL-compliant</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Literature Review</h2>
                    <p>First, I reviewed existing research and accommodation guidelines from educational institutions.
                        The goal was to understand how UDL principles are applied in practice and to build a structured
                        database that could guide the LLM. The materials were organized into a database containing each
                        guideline’s category, concrete examples of how it can be applied, and the target neurodivergent
                        group when specified.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/udl/database.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Initial Design of the System</h2>
                    <p>The initial system design used a three-column layout: the left panel displayed the original
                        material, the center showed the applied guidelines, and the right presented the modified
                        material. This structure allowed users to easily compare differences through highlighted changes
                        and understand which guideline affected each part of the text.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/udl/3-column.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Three-Step Design to Enhance Recommendation Quality</h2>
                    <p>The initial guideline recommendations and modifications were inconsistent, and the modified
                        materials often didn’t meet expectations. To improve quality, I split the task into three
                        smaller steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Suggesting UDL guidelines</li>
                        <li>Breaking the input material into chunks and mapping relevant guidelines to each chunk, and
                        </li>
                        <li>Generating modifications for each chunk.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Based on this change, I introduced an additional step in the interface that allows users to
                        select which suggested guidelines they want to apply. This created a two-step user
                        experience—first reviewing recommendations, then receiving the final modifications—which made
                        the outputs more predictable and reliable.</p>
                    <img src="subpage-assets/udl/select.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-section">
                    <h2>Revising to a Two-Column Design</h2>
                    <p>Based on feedback, I redesigned the interface using a two-column layout. In the left pane,
                        users can select or deselect guidelines to apply, and the right pane instantly reflects how
                        those choices change the course material. This side-by-side structure makes the impact of each
                        guideline more visible and easier to understand.</p>

                    <h2>Chat for Further Revision</h2>
                    <p>For each modified part, users can refine the content through a chat interface with the LLM.
                        The system also suggests helpful prompts to guide the conversation. Any changes made through
                        this chat are automatically applied to the modified material, allowing users to fine-tune
                        results with minimal effort.</p>
